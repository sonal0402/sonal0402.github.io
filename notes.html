<h1>Notes for You 📝</h1>
<div class="subtitle">
    Things I wanted to say slowly, honestly, and with love.
</div>

<div class="notes">

    <details>
        <summary>When I made you feel unseen 🫶</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            I know there have been moments where I didn’t notice you the way I should have.
            Moments where you were right there, trying, caring, showing up,
            and I was too caught up in my own thoughts, emotions, or noise to truly see you.
            <br><br>
            I want you to know it was never because you weren’t enough.
            It was because I wasn’t present enough.
            <br><br>
            I’m learning to be more aware, more intentional,
            and more gentle with the way I show you that you matter.
            You deserve to feel seen, valued, and chosen.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">I’m still learning 🤍</div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When my words hurt you 💔</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            Sometimes I speak before I fully think,
            especially when emotions are high.
            And in those moments, my words may have landed heavier
            than I ever intended.
            <br><br>
            Hurting you is never my intention,
            even when I’m upset or overwhelmed.
            My love for you doesn’t disappear in conflict.
            <br><br>
            I’m learning to slow down,
            to choose softness alongside honesty,
            and to remember that how I say things matters just as much as what I say.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">Choosing gentleness 💭</div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When I panicked instead of listening 😔</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            There are times when my fear speaks louder than my calm.
            When I panic, I react instead of listening,
            and I know that can make you feel unheard or pushed away.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry for the moments where I didn’t give you the space
            to finish your thoughts or explain your feelings.
            <br><br>
            I’m learning that not every situation needs fixing immediately.
            Sometimes it just needs patience, silence, and trust.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">Learning to breathe 🤍</div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When I wasn’t patient enough ⏳</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            I know patience hasn’t always been my strongest suit.
            There were moments where I rushed conversations,
            expected answers too quickly,
            or forgot that everyone processes things differently.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry for the times I made you feel pressured instead of supported.
            You deserved grace, not urgency.
            <br><br>
            I’m learning to slow down
            and trust the pace of us.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">Still growing 🌱</div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When I misunderstood you 💬</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            There have been moments where assumptions filled the gaps
            instead of understanding.
            Where I heard your words,
            but missed your intention.
            <br><br>
            I’m sorry for the times I didn’t ask more questions,
            didn’t pause,
            or didn’t give you the benefit of the doubt you deserve.
            <br><br>
            I’m learning to listen beyond my fears
            and trust the love behind your actions.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">Choosing trust 🤍</div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>When sorry wasn’t enough 🌧️</summary>
        <div class="note-text">
            I know there are moments where a simple sorry doesn’t fix the hurt.
            Where the impact lasts longer than the apology.
            <br><br>
            I want you to know my remorse isn’t only in words,
            it’s in reflection, effort, and the intention to do better.
            <br><br>
            I may stumble, but I’m committed to growing,
            learning, and loving you better every day.
        </div>
        <div class="note-end">With all my heart 🤍</div>
    </details>

    <div class="final-note">
        <details>
            <summary>Thank you for staying 🤍</summary>
            <div class="scroll-paper">
                If you’re reading this, it means you stayed.
                Through the long notes, the uncomfortable honesty,
                the softer admissions, and the parts where I wasn’t perfect.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for staying when things weren’t easy.
                Thank you for listening even when it was hard.
                Thank you for choosing patience, understanding,
                and love, again and again.
                <br><br>
                I know I don’t always get things right.
                I know I’m still learning, still growing,
                still figuring out how to love you better.
                But my intention has always been you.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for being here.
                Thank you for choosing us.
                And thank you, always, for staying.
